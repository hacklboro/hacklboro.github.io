      <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
      <p>A Hackathon is a collaborative, creative event where teams will develop software or hardware solutions to fix a set of problems set up by the event organizers. The event will last for 24h and it will put its atendees through a 'getting-work-done' environment which will be challenging yet rewarding.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="container right">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Who attends a Hackathon?</h2>
      <p>There are three clear stakeholders in a Hackathon. The organizing body (Hackathon committee, LSU, ...), the atendees (computer science students, design students, ...) and the sponsors. Sponsoring is a big part of making the event happen. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Why are sponsors involved?</h2>
      <p>As well as a coding challenge, a Hackathon is also a networking event. Sponsoring companies will have the opportunity to meet enthusiastic and talented programmers and designers. In return, as Hackathons are free to attend and food and prizes are provided, sponsors will help fund the event. This works out great for all parties, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of sorts; where sponsors attend because of the students, where students attend because of the sponsors and where it all is possible thanks to the organizers, which are able to fund it thanks to the sponsors, who are there because of the students... and so on.</p>

      <h2>Who will HackLboro be as a Hackathon?</h2>
      <p>As an event, and since it is our first year we will aim for a small-to-medium event; we are happy to plan from around 50 to 90 people. As a theme, HackLboro will be about 'Sports & Health'; this will determine the topics programmers code about, but also the path we take when choosing sponsors. As a committee, we believe that there is a real spot for a Hackathon in Loughborough University and we couldn't be happier to be part of, what we hope, will become a yearly event.</p>

      <h2>Our progress</h2>
      <p>We have a sponsor shortlist, we have a Sponsorship Document and we will be working at contacting our first round of sponsors throughout this week. We are also working on an almost finalized version of a Budget; this will take our planning process to the next step - sorting a day-plan for the event. Thanks to the LSU we now possibly have the venue, and that is a huge step. We are hoping to have the sponsorship shortlist finished within the next couple of weeks. After this we will hope to move to the next stage of the planning process - adversting the event.</p>

      <h2>What we would like to know from the LSU</h2>
      <p>It would be great to have some more information about the venue regarding dimensions. This would allow us to work out the optimal attendance, which would help our Budget production. Above all, and also relating to monetary figures, it would incredibly helpful to have a quote for the goods and services the LSU are offering (food, security, etc...etc...)</p>
